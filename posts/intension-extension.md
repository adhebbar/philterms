The **intension** of a term is its meaning. Intension is opposed to **extension**. The extension of a term is whatever it designates.

For example, Clark Kent and Superman designate the same person. However, these two sentences differ:

1. Lois Lane knows that Clark Kent is Clark Kent.
2. Lois Lane knows that Clark Kent is Superman.

Lois Lane trivially knows that Clark Kent is Clark Kent, but she doesn't know that Clark Kent is Superman. Despite being *co-extensive*, these two terms have different *meanings*. Similarly, consider these two sentences:

1. Shakespeare believes that water quenches his thirst.
2. Shakespeare believes that H2O quenches his thirst.

Assuming the year is 1600, (1) is likely true, but (2) is impossible, because the chemical formula for water does not exist yet.

These examples imply that something about a word's *sense* and something about a conversation's *context* matters when determining meaning. These examples also imply that many of our mental states, such as

* believing
* knowing
* fearing
* desiring

depend on *sense* or *context*.
