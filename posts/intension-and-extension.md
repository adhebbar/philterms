The **intension** of a \[term](...) is its meaning. The intension of the word "snake" is whatever "snake" means, which may include, beside properties of snakes, like "reptile", "vertebrate", etc., qualities or properties typically *associated* with snakes, such as: 

* the spooky sound of a rattlesnake's rattle 
* sliminess
* deceitfulness 

The **extension** of "snake" is whatever it designates -- whatever could truthfully be called a "snake." Calling your couch a snake is clearly false. But also is calling an eel a snake.
