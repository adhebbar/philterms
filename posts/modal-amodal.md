In psychology, a *modality* is [a medium of sensation, such as vision or hearing](https://dictionary.apa.org/modality). A [concept](...concepts) is modal if it has the same [mental representation](...) as sensation. 

For example, you may perceive a cat by hearing, smelling, feeling, or seeing it. According to indirect realists, this sensory experience *mentally represents* the cat. Perceiving the cat relates you to this mental representation.

The concept of CAT is *modal* if the mental representation of CAT is the same as this perceptual representation of the cat. 

The concept of CAT is *amodal* if the mental representation of CAT is something *more* than this perceptual representation of the cat.

For example, consider a chiliagon. A chiliagon is shape with 1,000 sides.

 (a picture would be dope here!) Chiliagons are perceptually the same circles, but the concept of CHILIAGON is different from the concept of CIRCLE. An amodal theorist uses this as evidence for amodal concepts. 

On the other hand, ... use an example
