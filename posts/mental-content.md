\*Content\* comes from the Latin word "contentus" meaning "contained." A \*\*mental content\*\* is a \*content\* of a mental state; mental states contain mental contents. Your mental state is your state of mind. Your mental state may be characterized as:

* a belief
* a desire
* a thought
* a perception

And so on. Mental states represent the world with mental contents. For example, you may believe that the earth is flat. If you believe that the earth is flat, then the \[meaning](...) of 'the earth is flat' is the *mental content* of your belief that the earth is flat.
