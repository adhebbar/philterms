\*Content\* comes from the Latin word "contentus" meaning "contained." \*\*Mental content\*\* is the \*content\* of a mental state. Your mental state is your state of mind. Your mental state may be characterized as:

* a belief
* a desire
* a thought
* a perception

And so on. For example, your mental state may be a belief. If you believe that the earth is flat, then the meaning of 'the earth is flat' is *mental content* of your belief.
