the 'extension' of a concept or expression is the set of things it extends to, or applies to, if it is the sort of concept or expression that a single object by itself can satisfy. Concepts and expressions of this sort are [monadic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(Greek_philosophy) "Monad (Greek philosophy)") or "one-place" concepts and expressions.
