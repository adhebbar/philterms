Mental states can be *about* things. They *concern* or *refer to:* 

* objects
* states of affairs
* ideas
* qualities

And so on. For example, a belief that 'bananas are yellow' is *about* bananas in the same way as this article is *about* intentionality. Intentionality refers to this *about-ness*.

Some reductive representationalists reduce conscious experience to intentionality (construed as \[mental representation](...)). If this explanation is accurate, then consciousness has a \[naturalistic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/) explanation.
