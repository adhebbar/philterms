Concepts are fundamental to thought. "Concept" comes from the Latin word "conceptum" meaning "something conceived."

Philosophers disagree about the nature of concepts. Some possible options:

* intensions
* mental representations of categories
* discriminatory abilities

And so on. People have thousands of concepts. Examples include:

* Categories like CATS
* Phrases like OVER THE RIVER AND THROUGH THE WOODS
* Abstract ideas like VALUE, FREEDOM, and FIVE THOUSAND
* Actions like RUN

And so on. Philosophers often use research from psychology and linguistics to reason about concepts. Philosophers in experimental philosophy debate whether concepts are [*modal* or *amodal*](...). Likewise, philosophers in conceptual engineering argue about revising concepts.
