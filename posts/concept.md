Concepts are fundamental to thought. "Concept" comes from the Latin word "conceptum" meaning "something conceived."

Philosophers disagree about the nature of concepts. Some proposals are:

* [intensions](/posts/intension-extension/)
* [mental representations](/posts/mental-representation/) of categories
* discriminatory abilities

And so on. For example, some believe that possessing the concept of CAT is just being able to distinguish cats from other things.

People have thousands of concepts. Examples include:

* Categories like CATS
* Phrases like OVER THE RIVER AND THROUGH THE WOODS
* Abstract ideas like VALUE, FREEDOM, and FIVE THOUSAND
* Actions like RUN

And so on. Philosophers often use research from psychology and linguistics to reason about concepts. Philosophers in experimental philosophy debate whether concepts are [*modal* or *amodal*](/posts/modal-amodal/). Likewise, philosophers in conceptual engineering argue about revising concepts.
