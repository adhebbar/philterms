A quale is a quality or feeling of conscious experience. Some examples:

* the taste of coffee 
* the sound of a violin
* the look of a red vase
* the touch of a fuzzy blanket.

When you touch a fuzzy blanket, it feels like something. That something is the quale of touching a fuzzy blanket. Qualia is the plural form of quale. 


Some argue that qualia aren’t reducible to physical facts — no knowledge of physics, chemistry, or biology could ever explain qualia. The problem of explaining qualia is referred to as the hard problem of consciousness. On this basis, some further argue for mind-body dualism.

Others disagree. They claim that, when you see red, you come to know a physical fact (such as the wavelengths of light in the room) in a different sense. You learn a new way of representing this fact. However, you could’ve learned this fact without consciously experiencing it. So, there is nothing irreducible about qualia.
