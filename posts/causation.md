A \*\*cause\*\* produces an \*\*effect\*\*. Except not always: smoking causes cancer, but smoking only sometimes results in cancer.

Causation, the general relation of causes to effects, is hard to analyze. Here are some well-known attempts: 

* Hume's \[regularity theory of causation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-regularity)
* David Lewis's \[counterfactual theory of causation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-counterfactual/)
* Pearl's and Woodward's \[interventionist theories of causation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-mani/#StruEquaDireGrapManiTheoCaus)

Interest in \[causal discovery](<https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00524>) and \[causal representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11107), two fields in which researchers attempt to discover causal relations from data, have grown out of the interventionist account.
