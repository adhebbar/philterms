A **cause** produces an **effect**. Except not always: smoking causes cancer, but you can smoke and not get cancer.

Causation refers to the general relation of causes to effects. Causation is hard to analyze. Some well-known attempts include:

* Hume's [regularity theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-regularity)
* David Lewis's [counterfactual theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-counterfactual/)
* Pearl's and Woodward's [interventionist theories](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-mani/#StruEquaDireGrapManiTheoCaus)

The interventionist accounts triggered interest in using machine learning methods to analyze causation and discover causal relations. Some active areas of research include [causal discovery](<https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00524>) and [causal representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11107).
