About
=================

Philosophy Terms makes philosophical jargon easy to understand. Philosophy has hundreds of complicated terms. For each term, we explain:

* *what* the term means
* *why* we use the term
* *where* we use the term

For example, "mereology" means "the study of parts and wholes," but why does anybody care about that? What important issues reason about parts and wholes? A good definition answers these questions.

We follow the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/) and we target a **high-school reading level**.

We aim to accompany the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/).
