Philosophy Terms makes philosophical jargon easy to understand and appreciate. Philosophy has many complicated terms. For each term, we explain:

* *what* the term means
* *why* it's important
* *where* it's used in philosophy

For example, "mereology" may be defined as "the study of parts and wholes", but why does anyone care about that? What important issues reason about parts and wholes? A good definition will answer all of these questions.

We follow the [](https://developers.google.com)[Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/) and we target a **high-school reading level**. 

Philosophy Terms should accompany the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/), not replace it.
